## Features

### Input parameters

The user should specify all the input parameters for the simulation in a parameterFileName.txt file. Users can make any text file a parameter file with a filename
of their choosing, as long as the contents of the file are formatted in a specified parameter name and value pair. Input values can be given in the format:
'Parameter Name = Parameter Value   #comment'. The list of all acceptable parameter names is given in the table below.



## Acknowledgments

The sequencing segment of the SDD_NGS Simulator was inspired by the ART Illumina sequencing tool published open-source by the US National Institute of Health.
Some of the in-built Illumina sequencer error profiles and the indel error rates used in SDD_NGS Simulator were adopted from the ART sequencing tool. 
We sincerely thank the authors Weichun Huang et al. for making the ART toolkit available open-source.
